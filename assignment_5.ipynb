Which values are more or less likely compared to the roll of a single six-sided die? What is the expected value of $R_{min}$? Plot the probability and cumulative distribution functions for $R_{min}$. Compute this by hand and simulate it using the law of large numbers.\n",

So you could roll, say, two sixes and then a four, and get a total of 16, or one three and get a total of 3, or twelve sixes and 1 and get 72, and so on. Write code to simulate this process, and determine its expected value using the law of large numbers. What is the probability of getting a total of 1, 2, 3, ... and so on, in your simulation? I recommend using simulations and the law of large numbers.  (Hint: The `while` loop might be useful in this case.)"
